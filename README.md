# TakardunBundle

A quite specialised document handling system. Mainly meant for inlusion in other applications, but possible to use on it's own.

The concept is that you link the documents to/from any entity in your application. By using the takardun service you can add new documents and get listings from your own template or controllers.

The concept is the same as with Sakonnin.
